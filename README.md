# 🏈 NFL Travel Distance Minimization – CO 370 Final Project

This project explores how the NFL (National Football League) can reduce its environmental impact by optimizing team travel using mathematical modeling and linear programming.

---

## 📌 Problem Overview

The NFL currently schedules 272 regular-season games across 32 teams, with a mix of divisional and inter-conference matchups. However, travel inefficiencies are built into this structure — teams like the Miami Dolphins must frequently travel far to face division rivals.

This project proposes a **restructured NFL schedule** that:
- Minimizes total travel distance across the league
- Maintains fairness and constraints (e.g., total games per team, home/away balance)
- Suggests more geographically efficient divisions
